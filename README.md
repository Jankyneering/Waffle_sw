## Compiling & Installing

### ```config.json```

In the ```waffle_platformio/data``` folder, there's a ```config.json``` file that you can use to configure the device.

```json
{
  "CALLSIGN": "ON4PFD",
  "XTIME_ADDRESS": 208,
  "ADDRESSES" : [ [100, 1],
                  [420, 2],
                  [-1, -1],
                  [-1, -1],
                  [-1, -1],
                  [-1, -1],
                  [-1, -1],
                  [-1, -1],
                  [-1, -1],
                  [-1, -1]
                ]
}
```

- ```CALLSIGN``` : Your callsign, will be displayed on the screen.
- ```XTIME_ADDRESS``` : The address of the XTIME POCSAG messages, leave it at 208 for DAPNET.
- ```ADDRESSES``` : The addresses of the POCSAG messages, the first element is the address, the second is the alert priority (-1: ignore, 0: store, 1: vibrate+screen, 2: buzzer+vibrate+screen).  
  You can add up to 10 RICs, or leave everything at -1 to ignore them.
